	<description>This is an example mod with two power generation buildings
-Dark Energy Generator
The generator provides energy for two days, but needs some power to recharge afterwards.
He can be used as an emergency generator.
-Wind Turbine
The wind turbine uses the wind to generate power.
It needs a clear wind path before and behind the blades.
Thanks to Architect for some of the ideas

For the SourceCode, look at the example dll project:
